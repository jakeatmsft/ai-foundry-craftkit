    "Sample: Workflow as Agent with Reflection and Retry Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose:\n",
    "This sample demonstrates how to wrap a workflow as an agent using WorkflowAgent.\n",
    "It uses a reflection pattern where a Worker executor generates responses and a\n",
    "Reviewer executor evaluates them. If the response is not approved, the Worker\n",
    "regenerates the output based on feedback until the Reviewer approves it. Only\n",
    "approved responses are emitted to the external consumer. The workflow completes when idle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts Demonstrated:\n",
    "- WorkflowAgent: Wraps a workflow to behave like a regular agent.\n",
    "- Cyclic workflow design (Worker \u2194 Reviewer) for iterative improvement.\n",
    "- AgentRunUpdateEvent: Mechanism for emitting approved responses externally.\n",
    "- Structured output parsing for review feedback using Pydantic.\n",
    "- State management for pending requests and retry logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prerequisites:\n",
    "- OpenAI account configured and accessible for OpenAIChatClient.\n",
    "- Familiarity with WorkflowBuilder, Executor, WorkflowContext, and event handling.\n",
    "- Understanding of how agent messages are generated, reviewed, and re-submitted.\n",
