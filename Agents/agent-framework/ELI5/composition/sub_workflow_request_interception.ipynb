    "\n",
    "This sample shows how to:\n",
    "1. Create workflows that execute other workflows as sub-workflows\n",
    "2. Intercept requests from sub-workflows using an executor with @handler for RequestInfoMessage subclasses\n",
    "3. Conditionally handle or forward requests using RequestResponse messages\n",
    "4. Handle external requests that are forwarded by the parent workflow\n",
    "5. Proper request/response correlation for concurrent processing\n",
    "\n",
    "The example simulates an email validation system where:\n",
    "- Sub-workflows validate multiple email addresses concurrently\n",
    "- Parent workflows can intercept domain check requests for optimization\n",
    "- Known domains (example.com, company.com) are approved locally\n",
    "- Unknown domains (unknown.org) are forwarded to external services\n",
    "- Request correlation ensures each email gets the correct domain check response\n",
    "- External domain check requests are processed and responses routed back correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "Key concepts demonstrated:\n",
    "- WorkflowExecutor: Wraps a workflow to make it behave as an executor\n",
    "- RequestInfoMessage handler: @handler method to intercept sub-workflow requests\n",
    "- Request correlation: Using request_id and source_executor_id to match responses with original requests\n",
    "- Concurrent processing: Multiple emails processed simultaneously without interference\n",
    "- External request routing: RequestInfoExecutor handles forwarded external requests\n",
    "- Sub-workflow isolation: Sub-workflows work normally without knowing they're nested\n",
    "- Sub-workflows complete by yielding outputs when validation is finished\n",
    "\n",
    "Prerequisites:\n",
    "- No external services required (external calls are simulated via `RequestInfoExecutor`).\n",
