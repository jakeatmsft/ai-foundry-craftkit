      "**1. Regulatory Compliance**  \n",
      "- **Local transportation laws**: Check speed limits, motor wattage limits, and classification rules for e-bikes in each target market (e.g., whether a license is needed).  \n",
      "- **Safety standards**: Comply with ISO/EN/ASTM standards for bicycles/e-bikes (brakes, lights, reflectors, frame durability).  \n",

      "- Substantiate any “eco-friendly” or “green” claims with data (life-cycle analysis, reduced emissions).  \n",
      "- Avoid unverified carbon footprint claims.\n",
      "\n",

      "- **Recall procedure**: Have a plan for addressing defects post-launch.\n",

      "\n",
      "**1. Regulatory Compliance**  \n",
      "- **Local transportation laws**: Check speed limits, motor wattage limits, and classification rules for e-bikes in each target market (e.g., whether a license is needed).  \n",
      "- **Safety standards**: Comply with ISO/EN/ASTM standards for bicycles/e-bikes (brakes, lights, reflectors, frame durability).  \n",
      "- **Battery & electrical safety**: Meet UL or equivalent certification for lithium-ion batteries to avoid fire hazards.  \n",
      "- **Import/export compliance**: Ensure CE marking (EU), FCC compliance (US for electronics), and other applicable marks.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Consumer Protection Requirements**  \n",
      "- **Accurate specifications**: Avoid exaggerated performance claims (range, speed, battery life).  \n",
      "- **Clear warranty terms**: State duration, coverage, and exclusions explicitly.  \n",
      "- **Return/refund policy**: Align with local consumer rights laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Marketing & Advertising Disclaimers**  \n",
      "- **Safety disclaimers**: Encourage helmet use, road awareness, and compliance with traffic laws.  \n",
      "- **Conditions of use**: Indicate suitable terrain, load limits, and intended commuter use.  \n",
      "- **Battery performance**: State that range depends on conditions (rider weight, terrain, temperature), to avoid misleading claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Environmental & Sustainability Claims**  \n",
      "- Substantiate any “eco-friendly” or “green” claims with data (life-cycle analysis, reduced emissions).  \n",
      "- Avoid unverified carbon footprint claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Risk Management & Liability**  \n",
      "- **Product liability insurance**: Protect against injury claims.  \n",
      "- **User manual quality**: Include clear assembly, charging, maintenance, and safety instructions.  \n",
      "- **Recall procedure**: Have a plan for addressing defects post-launch.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. Accessibility & Inclusivity Considerations**  \n",
      "- Consider adjustable frame sizes or features for diverse riders.  \n",
      "- Avoid marketing that excludes certain demographics or body types.\n",
      "\n",
      "**7. Data Privacy (If Smart Features Included)**  \n",
      "- If bike includes app or GPS tracking, ensure compliance with privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA).  \n",
      "- Provide clear data usage and consent notices.\n",
