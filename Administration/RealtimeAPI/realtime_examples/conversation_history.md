    {

    {
      "role": "system",
      "message": "Foundry supports integration with external platforms through APIs and Logic Apps. While direct support for open-source automation tools like n8n isn't the primary focus, you can connect Foundry to such tools using its APIs. For low-code scenarios, Power Apps and Logic Apps are recommended."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "message": "Whatâ€™s the roadmap for agent identities in Foundry?"
    },
    {
      "role": "system",
      "message": "Agent-specific identities are planned but not yet generally available. Current workarounds involve using managed identities and code-based solutions. Future releases will support distinct identities for individual agents within a tenant, improving resource access control."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "message": "Is there a sandbox environment to test Foundry capabilities?"
    },
    {
      "role": "system",
      "message": "Yes, Foundry offers an innovation sandbox environment where users can experiment with models and services. Access is typically coordinated through platform teams, and it's ideal for prototyping and testing integrations before production deployment."
    }
  ]
}      "message": "Can you explain what Azure AI Foundry is and how it helps with enterprise AI?"
    },
    {
      "role": "system",
      "message": "Azure AI Foundry is a unified platform for building, managing, and deploying enterprise-grade AI agents. It integrates models, tools, and orchestration capabilities into a single environment, supporting multi-agent workflows, observability, and governance. It includes services like Azure OpenAI, AI Speech, AI Vision, and AI Translator, and offers fine-tuning, safety, and enterprise connectivity features."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "message": "I am really only interested in the OpenAI models do you have gpt-5?"
    },
    {
      "role": "system",
      "message": "Foundry provides access to nearly 100 proprietary models maintained by Microsoft. These include models for speech, audio, video, image, and language. You can interact with them via APIs, customize them using prompt engineering, and even combine them for copilot-style applications."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "message": "Is there support for voice services?"
    },
    {
      "role": "system",
      "message": "Yes, Foundry includes real-time voice services that support text-to-speech with customizable voice talent. These services are integrated with LLMs for both response generation and audio output, and can be used to deliver natural-sounding transcripts or interactive voice experiences."
